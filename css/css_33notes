What is fixed positioning? When would you use it?

An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.

If you want to keep an element is the same spit you would use fixed.

What are relative and absolute positioning?

An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.

Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).

However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.

What is a z-index? When might that come in handy?

The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element.

An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.

Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position:absolute, position:relative, or position:fixed).
