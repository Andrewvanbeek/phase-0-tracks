# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a means that allows us to have the most updated and accurate version of a document or file while working indvidually or with a team.  It allows to keep track of our changes and ensure the apporiate edits are saved.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is seperate track in git that we can use as a protoyping enviroment in our workflow when creating a new feature, or working with another team member.  It allows us to have a place to edit files before committing and merging it to the master branch.  It stems from the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit can be thought of as a save point for our work, for us to later refer to.  A commit message is good if it accurately describes what changes to the files have been during the changes committed.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is a conflict when changes from two different branches or users conflict each other and merged at the same time.  An example is if two different team members were working on the same document and for some reason they edited the same line and git would not know who was correct!
