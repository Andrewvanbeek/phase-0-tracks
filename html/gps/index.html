<section><h2>Review and Reflect</h2>
<p>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful? -Html 5 semantics tags are meanting organizing the elements and the webpage in a structure hiearchy for several reasons referring either to the reading disabled, SEO, to best practice.  I think the nav tag is the most useful to me.
<br>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?- If it was set up with articles it could like the following: first have a h1 then followed by an article with a h2 heading.  Then another article with a h2 heading.  This can differ between your usage of sections, articles, mains, and etc.
<br>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? - I learned about snippets and snippet syntax whcih I think could be really usef in the future for writing code tempaltes, such as standard webpage tempale with the elements I need like a table or list and etc.
<br>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept? - I think mastering the semantic concepts were challenging, and I think the way I can fix this is to read more about it.</p>
