## Virtual Private Server

*In my own words I bascially think a virtual private server(provided through the internet/cloud hosting company) is a basically a computer environment similar to our computer, except the main difference we only can access and interact with terminal and the command line which makes sense.  Since a lot uses around a virtual private server deals with application development or some type of coding work it it be operations, or maybe even using it to manage a database.  Just like our computers we can download what we want on it and manage it as our own.  Something unique and added benefit is there are services like digital ocean and amazon that provide these vps for you, but also make it easy to make these vps into web or applications servers that allow you present the applications you developed onto the internet.
