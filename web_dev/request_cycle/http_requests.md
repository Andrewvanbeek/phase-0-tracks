What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

-Get request is a request that actually retrieves the data.

-A post request is a request that submits the data to processed in some way or manner.

-Get can be used if you just wanted to take data from the web, while a post request actually takes data and inserts somewhere to be processed.  I think get could be used to display information back to us, while Post as I saw could be used from a form and take the form data to be store somewhere and the processed.
