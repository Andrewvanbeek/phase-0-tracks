Variables
1. What is a variable? Why might a programmer use a variable?

Variables are means to store a specific value of data while also labeling that values so you later reference in your ruby code.  A programmer might use a variable as way to easily reference a value multiple times.  For example if they want to reference the pi value of 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510, they could just store in it a variable called pi (pi = 3.14159265358979323846264338327950288419716939937510).  Then call simply print the pi variable each time they wanted that value.
   

2. If the value of first_name is "Abraham" and last_name is "Lincoln", explain the order in which Ruby will run the line full_name = first_name + last_name, and what the final result will be.

Ruby will add the variables within the full_name variable of the variables from left to right.  This will cause first_name to have last_name added to it resulting in “AbrahamLincoln” (there is no space within the strings).

Data Types
3. For each of the following data types, write a short definition and give at least one example of when you might use the data type in a program. (Don't use an example we've already provided.)

string - is an object that holds arbitrary characters that are human readable.  They do not have distinct numeric value unless a specific method is run on them.  They are usually in “” for example “Hey!” is a string.  Could use if you were trying to print a message to a user like “Hello!”.

integer - An integer is object with numeric value.  “5” would still be a string since is characters by quotes, but 5 is integer because it a number and it data with value that can be directly manipulated by math.  For example you could set a variable as the value of two integers added together like a = 5 +4.

float-  A float is integer, but traditional integers end before the decimal mark making them whole numbers.  A float are integers that have the decimal such as 4.3, 0.2 and etc.  To change a normal integer or string with a number into a float, just use the .to_f command.  Makes sense if you are working with dollars 4.45 dollars for example.

nil -  Is basically there is no value yet, but it can be more closely resembled to N/A.  You can not add or manipulate nil, it is more of a placeholder value, in that nil is not the same as 0 in terms of an integer, and is not the same as “” as a string.  

boolean- Can be true or false.  For example a = false is a boolean.  Can have many applications for example as a means to keep a loop running: while x = false do xyz. 


Algorithms
